The Mosquito Ovitrap Index (MOI) of these cities, providing insights into the fluctuation
of Aedes mosquito populations, was obtained from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission (https://wsjkw.gd.gov.cn). 
According to the monitoring guidelines for dengue vector
published by the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission, monitoring staff establish multiple monitoring points in each city to assess the populations of Aedes mosquitoes, including
both Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. The combined results of these two mosquito species
will be used as the overall monitoring results for Aedes mosquitos. The Guangdong Provincial
Health Commission reports monitoring results every half month. These reports detail the proportions of four categories of monitoring points in each city—meeting epidemic prevention
and control standards, low-density, medium-density, and high-density areas—with corresponding MOI values for each category. Based on the distribution of monitoring points across
different monitoring levels, we can calculate the data of 100 monitoring points for each city. In
addition, considering the differences in data reporting methods before 2015 and the potential
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population dynamics of Aedes mosquitoes after
2020, the study period was selected from 2016 to 2019 to ensure reliability and accuracy.
